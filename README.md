The **BEST music separation** software with help of A.I. ... **to my ears** ! 👂👂

As you've guessed, it was made specially for Karaoke (▶️ focus on musical part).  
This project is **open to all goodwill**.  

Discord community, Chat-GPT & Copilot ...  **and my human intelligence** made this project possible.

KaraFan works **on Your PC** if you have a decent GPU or with **Google Colab** !!

# 🔥 INTRODUCTION

I'm an amateur Rock singer who has often been disappointed by the inability to find songs of my favorite singers in the vast KAR databases I possess, or in the extensive library of thousands of songs offered by « KaraFun » (with a paid subscription).

Of course, you have all the singers's best-of, but it's not always the songs you want to sing.

And if the singer is not very famous, you'll find 3-4 songs with real musicians playing or you will have to sing on a MIDI file, which is not very pleasant (even with "Sound Fonts"), or you can forget it ... until ...

# 💤 AN OLD DREAM

Since my childhood, I sing everytime and I've been dreaming of a software that would allow me to remove the voice of a song to sing on it.

TODAY, I'M 54 YEARS OLD, I'M STILL SINGING, AND MY DREAM HAS COME TRUE !

Now, I have the ability to create my own « **KFN** » files for my favorite songs, featuring real musicians who played on the original track, and use them with my beloved software : « KaraFun » 🎤💋

[KaraFun](https://www.karafun.com/) is a free software that you can use to play Karaoke files on your PC.  
They have subscription plans to access their huge library of songs, but you can also use for free with **your own** MID, KAR, CDG & KFN files !!

Perhaps it's time to turn on your dreams too ... ?

# 🧒 BIOGRAPHY

# 📆 HISTORY

I first started with the Demucs facebook research model, but I was disappointed with the results, especially with the instrumental part.

Then I discovered the MDX model, and I was amazed by the quality of the results, especially with the vocals and the instrumental part.

But I was still disappointed with the instrumental part, which was **not shining enough** for me.

So I decided to create my own process, based on the MDX models, but with the **best instrumental** that I could get.  
(Remembers : It's for **Karaoke !**).

I also added a few tricks to improve the quality of the results.

# 🦄 NEAR FUTURE

You will see ... I have hundreds of ideas, but I need time to implement them.

And as I'm an independent developer, I have to work to earn my living.

So if you want to encourage me to give more time to improve this project,  
you can make a donation or become one of my patrons :

🎵 **[Go back to the top of this page](#-karafan)** 🎵 where you can find the donation buttons.

**This helps me to :**

- Pay calculation time on Google Colab (100 units = 11 €, I eat all in 3-4 days)
- Perhaps, buy new hardware to make more and more tests to improve the quality of the results.  
  I'm currently using a 4 years old laptop with a GTX 1060 Ti **4GB**  
  I'm dreaming of a **RTX 4090** ... and I'm NOT a gamer !  
  ... and if you are too generous, Me can buy an **Nvidia A100 40GB** !! 😍
