# MVSEP-MDX23-Colab fork v2.2.1
Adaptation of MVSep-MDX23 algorithm for Colab, with few tweaks:

**v2.2.1**
* Added custom weights feature
* Fixed some bugs
* Fixed input: you can use a file or a folder as input now

**v2.2**
* Added MDXv3 compatibility
* Added MDXv3 demo model D1581 in vocals stem multiband ensemble
* Added MDX-VOC-FT *Fullband SRS* in vocals stem multiband ensemble
* Added option to output only vocals/instrum stems (faster processing)
* Added 16bit output format option
* Added "BigShift trick" for MDX models
* Added separated overlap values for MDX, MDXv3 and Demucs
* Fixed volume compensations fine-tuned
* Fixed some memory issues

[**v2.1 (by deton24)**](https://github.com/deton24/MVSEP-MDX23-Colab_v2.1)
* Updated with MDX-VOC-FT instead of Kim Vocal 2

[**v2.0**](https://github.com/jarredou/MVSEP-MDX23-Colab_v2/tree/2.0)
* Updated with new Kim Vocal 2 & UVR-MDX-Instr-HQ3 models
* Folder batch processing
* Fixed high frequency bleed in vocals
* Fixed volume compensation for MDX models

# MVSEP-MDX23-music-separation-model
Model for [Sound demixing challenge 2023: Music Demixing Track - MDX'23](https://www.aicrowd.com/challenges/sound-demixing-challenge-2023). Model perform separation of music into 4 stems "bass", "drums", "vocals", "other". Model won 3rd place in challenge (Leaderboard C).

Model based on [Demucs4](https://github.com/facebookresearch/demucs), [MDX](https://github.com/kuielab/mdx-net) neural net architectures and some MDX weights from [Ultimate Vocal Remover](https://github.com/Anjok07/ultimatevocalremovergui) project (thanks [Kimberley Jensen](https://github.com/KimberleyJensen) for great high quality vocal models). Brought to you by [MVSep.com](https://mvsep.com).
## Usage

```
    python inference.py --input_audio mixture1.wav mixture2.wav --output_folder ./results/
```

With this command audios with names "mixture1.wav" and "mixture2.wav" will be processed and results will be stored in `./results/` folder in WAV format.

* **Note 1**: If you have not enough GPU memory you can use CPU (`--cpu`), but it will be slow. Additionally you can use single ONNX (`--single_onnx`), but it will decrease quality a little bit. Also reduce of chunk size can help (`--chunk_size 200000`).
* **Note 2**: In current revision code requires less GPU memory, but it process multiple files slower. If you want old fast method use argument `--large_gpu`. It will require > 11 GB of GPU memory, but will work faster.  

## Quality comparison

Quality comparison with best separation models performed on [MultiSong Dataset](https://mvsep.com/quality_checker/leaderboard2.php?sort=bass). 

| Algorithm     | SDR bass  | SDR drums  | SDR other  | SDR vocals  | SDR instrumental  |
| ------------- |:---------:|:----------:|:----------:|:----------:|:------------------:|

* Note: SDR - signal to distortion ratio. Larger is better.
